            <h1>Pre-production & a World Adventure</h1>
            <p>Moris began working in Blitz3D before switching to Unity in 2014. His first project in Unity was the World Adventure Project, an effort to port the 2008 game Sonic Unleashedâ€”which, similar to the 2006 game, he had no way of playingâ€”to Windows. He abandoned the World Adventure Project after realizing he had the ability to remake Sonic the Hedgehog in Unity and thus be able to experience it, despite the low quality of his computer setup. He also saw the opportunity to fix its problems and restore content that had been scrapped during development, "[giving] it a second chance." Although he had never played the game, Moris, from analyzing gameplay footage, had a strong sense of what he needed to recreate. He made a folder housing gigabytes of reference material, including footage from both prerelease and post-release.</p>

            <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu">The Sonic-Release</h1>
            <p>Moris released the first demo of Project '06â€”containing two levels, "Wave Ocean" and "Kingdom Valley"â€”in April 2019. An update containing bug fixes, improved widescreen support, and other minor improvements, was released the following month. The second demo, which added the three levels; "Dusty Desert", "Flame Core", and "Radical Train", was released in October 2019, and a bug-fix update was released in November. Following the November update, Moris took a break to focus on other projects. He is unsure when the remake will be complete: "A wild guess would probably be in two years, but I'm very unsure about that." A third demo was released in July 2020 which added the rest of the stages in Sonic's story, followed by an update in August 2020 that addressed numerous bugs in the previous build.</p>

            <p>After the August build, Moris took a break from the project to work on another fangame, Sonic Riders Overdrive. A fourth demo was released in September 2021 that added Shadow and all of his campaign levels, followed by a bugfix update later that month.</p>
